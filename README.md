# INSPETTO
<p style="font-style=italics;">Made for HACKON 2.0, MCET, Anad</p>

INSPETTO is a cutting-edge surveillance solution designed to **detect tampered or illegal vehicle number plates** using computer vision, OCR, and beacon-based verification. It enables law enforcement agencies to track and verify vehicles in real-time with high accuracy.

## üì¶ Features

- üîç Real-time license plate detection using OCR  
- üß† Automatic classification: **valid**, **tampered**, or **illegal format**  
- üì° Beacon-chip verification using hardware hubs  
- üóÉÔ∏è Centralized database with camera logs, violations, and vehicle data  
- üåê REST API for data access and integration

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MTCodes01/Inspetto-team-7.git
cd Inspetto-team-7
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
start.bat
```

To begin OCR detection:

```bash
cd backend
python OCRing.py
```

> INSPETTO captures plates from your **webcam**. Simply show a number plate image to simulate detection.

## üé• Input Source & Usage

- Accepts **live video feed** from a webcam  
- Uses `pytesseract` to extract plate numbers from frames  
- Beacon hubs detect the **chip ID** inside nearby vehicles  
- Both logs are sent to the backend for verification

## üß† How It Works ‚Äì Classification Logic

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Camera captures license plate and OCR extracts plate number |
| 2 | Hub reads Bluetooth beacon inside vehicle (`chip_id`) |
| 3 | Server cross-verifies plate number and chip against DB |
| 4 | System classifies plate as one of the following: |

### Classification Rules

| Type            | Criteria                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Valid          | Plate matches regex + high OCR confidence + beacon ID is linked         |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Tampered       | Valid-looking plate but mismatched/missing beacon                      |
| üö´ Illegal Format | Plate doesn't match official regex pattern                             |
| ‚ùì Low Confidence | OCR confidence below threshold (e.g., `< 70%`)                          |

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

INSPETTO uses **MySQL** to manage vehicle, camera, and violation data.

### Key Tables

- `users` ‚Äì officer login system  
- `cameras` ‚Äì camera location and metadata  
- `vehicles` ‚Äì plate, chassis, and owner data  
- `violations` ‚Äì logged anomalies  
- `hubs`, `hub_logs` ‚Äì beacon-based location tracking  
- `scan_logs` ‚Äì OCR scan history  
- `vehicle_documents`, `vehicle_route_logs` ‚Äì registration and movement history  

Example from `scan_logs`:
```sql
scan_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
plate_no VARCHAR(20)
cam_id VARCHAR(20)
confidence FLOAT
timestamp DATETIME
plate_image BLOB
```

## üëÆ Law Enforcement Interface

Web dashboard at [inspetto.ceal.in](https://inspetto.ceal.in) provides:

- üìç Live scan monitoring  
- üö¶ Violation feed per camera  
- üßæ Vehicle and route log search  
- üëÅÔ∏è Role-based officer login (currently read-only)  

> Action-based features (e.g. reviewing violations) are planned for future versions.

## üß™ Testing & Simulation

You can simulate detection without hardware.

### Simulate OCR

1. Open a plate image on your phone or screen  
2. Run the OCR script and hold the plate in front of the webcam

### Simulate Beacon + Data

```bash
python backend/layout-db.py  # creates tables
python manage.py seed_data   # seeds with test entries
```

Make sure to edit your DB credentials in the source code before running.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

INSPETTO does **not yet use `.env` files**. All sensitive settings (e.g. DB credentials) must be manually edited in:

- `backend/layout-db.py`  
- `seed_data.py`

### Future Recommendation

Switch to `.env` + `python-dotenv` to manage credentials and environment settings securely.
