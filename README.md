## About the Project

Welcome to **INSPETTO**, a cutting-edge surveillance solution designed to combat the manipulation and misuse of vehicle number plates. 🚔

From hidden plates to tampered or illegal formats, identifying these anomalies has long posed a challenge for law enforcement. Traditional systems are slow, manual, and unable to handle high-traffic situations.

**INSPETTO** changes that. Using real-time image recognition powered by computer vision, our system detects suspicious license plates on the fly and cross-verifies them against categorized records—making our roads safer and smarter.

## Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Detection & Classification**
- 🎥 Captures live vehicle footage using a Python-based camera interface.
- 🧠 Detects tampered, hidden, or illegally formatted number plates using computer vision algorithms.
- ⚡ Classifies plates instantly as **legal**, **illegal**, **case-registered**, or **stolen**.

### 2. **Database Cross-Verification**
- 🔍 Cross-checks number plates against an SQL database.
- 📂 Organized into multiple categories for fast and accurate identification.
- 🛡️ Supports law enforcement in verifying vehicles against existing records.

### 3. **Multi-Vehicle Processing**
- 🚗 Capable of analyzing several vehicles at once.
- 🚦 Perfect for high-traffic zones like toll booths, checkpoints, and city-wide surveillance systems.

### 4. **Automated Alerts and Visual Output**
- 🖥️ Displays plate classification results in real-time.
- 🚨 Triggers automated alerts for suspicious or criminal vehicles.

## How Are We Different?

Most surveillance tools can only *read* plates. We go further by:
- **Detecting anomalies** like obscured, modified, or invalid plate formats.
- **Automating real-time classification and alerts** without human intervention.
- **Supporting enforcement** through integration with crime and registration databases.
